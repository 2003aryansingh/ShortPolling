# Short Polling Demo Repository

This repository contains a simple demonstration of short polling, a client-side polling technique used in web development for periodically fetching data from a server.

## Description

Short polling is a simple polling technique where the client sends periodic requests to the server to fetch updated data. The server responds with the latest data, and the client updates the UI accordingly. This process is repeated at regular intervals to keep the data updated in the client's view.

This demonstration repository includes a sample web application that showcases short polling.
